# Experiment Guidelines  

## Notice  
In our earlier experiment, **"SEUCRA"** was referred to as **CABR-LoRA**.  
- We use `Traintype: "CABR-LoRA"` to denote **M1 SECURA**.  
- `Traintype: "CABR-LoRA_L"` corresponds to the **M2 merge method**.  
- If you would like to test the basic **CABR-LoRA_Only**, please set `Traintype` to `"CABR-LoRA_Only"`.  

Thank you for your understanding.

## About the Experiment  
As mentioned in our paper, most of our datasets are available on **BBM** and **Hugging Face**, so we will not upload them here.  

Our experiments consist of five main parts:  

- **EXP0/AddingTestSVDAnalysis** â†’ **SVD Norm Analysis**  
- **EXP2** â†’ **Performance Comparison of LoRA Variants**  
- **EXP3** â†’ **Gradient-Based Experiment**  
- **EXP4** â†’ **Knowledge Retention at 1e-3 under Different LoRA Variants**  
- **EXP5** â†’ **Continuous Training with Different Knowledge Retention Methods**  

### **Experiment Setup**  
For each experiment setup, please modify `src/Processer` and adjust the **vocab_size** parameter in `to_one_hot`.

## Final Note  
As an undergraduate student working independently, without any teaching assistants or collaborators, it has been challenging to manage daily email inquiries. However, if I come across your email, I will respond as soon as possible.  

Thank you for your patience! ðŸš€
